todo list

- add google maps api calls for distance
- begin discord api integration:
  - 1 Start with just putting rides lists into discord
  - 2 Server specific user config, so that individual members can set name, address
  - 3 O shoot I think imma have to add a name field in the human class too
  - 4 Then set up the reaction feature in order to set up rides based on server profiles
      - Server profile will need:
      - Storage of the discord id, the name, driver/rider status, if driver, capacity, address
  - 5 Then set up the actual command function: in order to set either unified start, unified drop off, or dist pick up, dist drop off
  - 6 Also add command in order for people to select whether or not they will be driving
  - 7 Also add command for custom car:
      - eg we're all leaving large group, can pick a car to get into through reactions
